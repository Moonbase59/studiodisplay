;
; All MQTT topics MUST have a trailing "/"!
; Design decision: Internally, on the MQTT message bus, we always
; work with metric units, these need to be converted as needed.
;
; Clients have their "base" topic set in "client_topic"
; and can have the following implemented in a unfied way:
;   client_topic/connected -- Connection status (0, 1, 2)
;   client_topic/status/… -- Status reports (usually retained)
;   client_topic/set/… -- Change/action requests (never retained)
;   client_topic/get/… -- Active get, publishes in status (never retained)
;   client_topic/command/… -- Command channel (never retained)
;
; If a device has a non-empty "publish_topic", this will be used for
; status updates instead of the standard "client_topic/status/…".
; This way, a device can have its unique connected/get/set/command interface
; while still publishing into a common hypothetical "item" like "the Studio".
;
; For pure signalling devices, a non-empty "subscribe_topic" will be used.
; This way, we can keep the device-dependent topics as above.
;
; For more than one device of the same kind,
; use different client_id and client_topic like so:
;   client_id = device1
;   client_topic = device/1/
;
; Quality of Service:
;   QoS 0 is no guaranteed delivery, no duplicates possible
;   QoS 1 (guaranteed delivery, duplicates possible) should be avoided.
;   QoS 2 is guaranteed delivery, no duplicates possible

[mqtt]
; ALL modules read from this section to find their broker connection data
; For simplicity and energy-saving, we run the MQTT broker
; on the first StudioDisplay (a Raspberry Pi 3B or 3B+).
host = studiodisplay1
port = 1883
websockets_port = 9001
; Base topic to distinguish different users, etc. Can be left empty.

[localization]
; Currently, only the web client and the Weather Underground
; use localization features.
; JavaScript-type locale, i.e. "de-DE" or "en-GB"
;locale = de-DE
;
; Units:
;   temperature: C,F,K (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
;   speed: km/h,mph,m/s (kilometers/miles per hour, meters/second)
;   pressure: hPa,mbar,mmHg,inHg,bar,Pa (hektopascal, millibar, mm Hg, in Hg, bar, Pascal)
;   precipitation: mm/in for millimeters or inches
;   snowfall: cm/in for centimeters or inches
;   elevation: m/ft for meters or feet
; Speed, pressure, precipitation and snowfall have selectable precision.
;
; All these are now defined within the locale files, as special entries
; featuring a leading dot (".temperature", ".temperature_text").
; I still leave the description here since JSON files can’t have comments.
; The Javascript will perform all needed calculations (we use metric values
; internally) and take care of handling HTML elements like this:
;   <span class="i18n">.temperature_text</span>
; or (preferred)
;   <span class=".temperature"></span>
; Both will fill the inner HTML of the element with the current
; contents of ".temperature_text" as specified in the language file.
